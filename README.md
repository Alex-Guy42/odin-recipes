Before starting the Project:
This project will involve building a basic recipe website. It will have a main index page with links to a few recipes.

The website won't look pretty by the time I have finished it. However, I will have demonstrated my HTML skills by the time I have finished.

I will revisit this project in the future with CSS.

After finishing the Project:
I felt I was able to remember the HTML syntax well. I forgot a few things when it came to using github, however it quickly came back to me. I feel confident moving on after completing thiis project.
